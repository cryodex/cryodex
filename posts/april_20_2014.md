Recent news and NSA leaks prove that the Internet is in need of new safeguards for data privacy and security.

Cryodex is a cloud encryption gateway that provides database security as a service for new and existing applications.

Cryodex leverages the latest advances in encryption technology to enable strong encryption while preserving 
application functionality. 

For the first time, Cryodex lets developers transparently encrypt data at the click of a button, preserving user privacy,
providing turn-key regulatory compliance, and preventing data leakages due to software vulnerabilities.

Cryodex is currently undergoing beta testing with a closed group of participants and reviewers.
