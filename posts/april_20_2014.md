As businesses are moving massive amounts of data into the cloud, recent vulnerabilities and NSA leaks prove that the Internet is in need of new safeguards for privacy and security. Yet traditional approaches to data security are too slow and cumbersome for the cloud.

Cryodex defies the status quo by leveraging the latest advances in encryption technology, enabling strong encryption while preserving application functionality. For the first time, developers will be able to transparently encrypt data at the click of a button, preserving user privacy,
providing turn-key regulatory compliance, and preventing data leakages due to software vulnerabilities.

Cryodex is currently undergoing beta testing with a closed group of participants and reviewers.
