It has been a great first year for Syme. 

Thousands of you have come to Syme for a more private and secure alternative to existing social networks. 

Recent news and NSA leaks prove that the Internet is in need of new privacy safeguards. Providing these safeguards is not an easy task. But the tech community is now coming together to build better, more user-friendly encryption tools, so that the average person could access the resources needed to secure personal data. 

Hundreds of users wrote to us and provided helpful feedback on how to improve Syme. Throughout the process, we received many requests to adapt Syme to teamwork and collaboration. 

It is with that in mind that we’ve built the next version of our software. Soon, you will be able to use Syme to set up secure communications across your team or business in less than a minute. We are very excited to show you what we’ve been up to.

The former version of Syme will stay live on the Chrome Web Store, and you’ll still be able to access your old groups.

If you’re interested in getting early access, just sign up on our homepage. We promise to keep you posted.
